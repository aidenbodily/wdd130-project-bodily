                    <h3>San Francisco Peaks</h3>
                    <p>This is a photo I took of the San Francisco Peaks in Flagstaff, Arizona. I took this photo on my mission after knocking on a door to try to contact someone but they weren’t home, it was taken from the east of the peaks somewhere off of E Empire Ave. I love the composition of it so much and it’s one of my favorite photos Ive ever taken.</p>

                    <h3>Sycamore Falls</h3>
                    <p>This photo was taken just outside Williams, Arizona at a waterfall called Sycamore Falls. It’s a seasonal waterfall and this photo was taken Late April or Early May as the snow was all melting, genuinely just one of the prettiest places I’ve been to in my life.</p>

                    <h3>Shady Field</h3>
                    <p>I really don’t know what to name this one so there is a generic title, this was also taken in Flagstaff, Arizona. In fact pretty much all the pictures on this page were. This was taken in an empty lot located at 1708 N West St facing East. We had just left someone’s house and walking down the sidewalk I saw this composition and knew I had to take a photo of it.</p>

                    <h3>Rainbow Sunset</h3>
                    <p>This photo was taken just down the street from the Shady Field photo, just on the street outside 1915 E Johnson Ave. This picture was also taken facing East. It was sunset and there was a rainbow so I thought it was a really cool photo and turns out I was right.</p>
